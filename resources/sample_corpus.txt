Hello there, my name is Mr Chatter.
I like to practice English every single day.
The sky is blue, the grass is green, and the sun feels warm.
Learning new words helps me build clear sentences.
Please speak slowly so that I can understand better.
I read short stories and repeat them aloud to improve my accent.
Good manners and cheerful greetings make conversations friendly.
Curiosity helps me ask thoughtful questions about the world.
Kind words and patience create a positive learning space.
When I make a mistake, I try again and celebrate the progress.
